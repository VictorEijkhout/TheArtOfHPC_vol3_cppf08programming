\Level 0 {Unsigned types}
\label{sec:unsigned-cmp}

For the integer types \indexc{int}, \indexc{short}, \indexc{long}
there are unsigned types
\begin{lstlisting}
unsigned int i;
unsigned short s;
unsigned long l;
\end{lstlisting}
which contain nonnegative values.
Consequently they have twice the range:
%
\snippetwithoutput{unsignedlimit}{int}{limit}

(For the mechanism used here, see section~\ref{sec:limits}.)

Unsigned values are fraught with danger. For instance,
comparing them to integers gives counter-intuitive results:
%
\snippetwithoutput{unsignedcomp}{int}{cmp}

For this reason, \cppstandard{20} has introduced utility functions
\lstinline+cmp_equal+ and such (in the \indexc{utility} header)
that do these comparisons correctly.

\Level 0 {Integer precision}
\label{sec:shortintlong}

In addition to \lstinline{int},
there are also \indexcdef{short} and \indexcdef{long} integers.
\verbatimsnippet{intshortlong}

\begin{itemize}
\item A short int is at least 16 bits;
\item An integer is at least 16 bits, which was the case
  in the old days of the \indexterm{DEC PDP-11},
  but nowadays they are commonly 32 bits;
\item A long integer is at least 32 bits, but often~64;
\item A `long long' integer is at least 64 bits.
\item If you need only one byte for your integer, you can use a \lstinline{char};
  see section~\ref{sec:charint}.
\end{itemize}

There are a number of generally accepted \indextermp{data model}
for the definition of these types; see \HPSCref{sec:data-model}.

If you want to determine precisely what the range of
integers or real numbers is that is stored in an \lstinline{int} or \lstinline{float}
variable, you can use \indextermheader{limits}; see section~\ref{sec:limits}.

If you want to dictate how many bits to use, there is
the \indextermheader{cstdint} header, which defines such types
as \indexc{int16_t}, \indexc{int32_t}, \indexc{int64_t}.

\Level 0 {Floating point types}

Truncation and precision are tricky things.
As a small illustration, let's do the same computation
in single and double precision.
While the results show the same with the default \lstinline{cout}
formatting,
if we subtract them we see a non-zero difference.

\snippetwithoutput{truncvsf}{basic}{point3}

You can actually explain the size of this difference,
however, we defer discussion of the details
of floating point arithmetic to
\HPSCref[chapter]{ch:arithmetic}.

\Level 0 {Limits}
\label{sec:limits}

There used to be a header file \indextermtt{limits.h} that contained
macros such as \indexc{MAX_INT} and \indexc{MIN_INT}.
While this is still available,
the \ac{STL} offers a better solution in the
\indexc{numeric_limits} function
of the \indextermheader{numeric} header.

\begin{block}{Templated functions for limits}
  \label{sl:stl-limits}
  Use header file \indextermtt{limits}:
\begin{lstlisting}
#include <limits>
using std::numeric_limits;

cout << numeric_limits<long>::max();
\end{lstlisting}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Limits of floating point values}
  \label{sl:float-limits}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The largest number is given by \indexcdef{max};
    use \indexcdef{lowest} for `most negative'.
  \item The smallest denormal number is given by \indexcdef{denorm_min}.
  \item \indexcdef{min} is the smallest positive number
    that is not a denormal;
  \item There is an \indexcdef{epsilon} function for machine precision:
  \end{itemize}
  \snippetwithoutput{stllimitfloat}{stl}{eps}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Some limit values}
  \label{sl:ieee-limits}
    \def\codesize{\ttfamily\scriptsize}
  \snippetwithoutput{stllimits}{stl}{limits}
\end{block}

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:big-factorial}
  Write a program to discover what the maximal~$n$ is so that~$n!$,
  that is, $n$-factorial, can be represented in an \n{int}, \n{long},
  or \n{long long}. Can you write this as a templated function?
\end{exercise}

Operations such as dividing by zero lead to floating point numbers
that do not have a valid value. For efficiency of computation, the
processor will compute with these as if they are any other floating
point number.

\Level 1 {Not-a-number}
\label{sec:naninf}

The \indextermbus{IEEE}{754} standard for floating point numbers
states that certain bit patterns correspond to the value
\indextermtt{NaN}: `not a number'.
This is the result of such computations as the square root
of a negative number, or zero divided by zero;
you can also explicitly generate it
with \indexc{quiet_NaN} or \indexc{signalling_NaN}.

\begin{itemize}
\item \n{NaN} is only defined for floating point types:
  the test \indexc{has_quiet_NaN} is false for other types
  such as \indexc{bool} or \indexc{int}.
\item Even through \indexc{complex} is built on top of
  floating point types, there is no \n{NaN} for it.
\end{itemize}

\snippetwithoutput{nanhasnan}{limits}{nan}

\Level 1 {Tests}

There are tests for detecting whether a number is \indextermtt{Inf} or
\indextermtt{NaN}. However, using these may slow a computation down.

\begin{block}{Detection of Inf and NaN}
  The functions \indexc{isinf} and \indexc{isnan} are
  defined for the floating point types (\n{float}, \n{double}, \n{long
    double}), returning a \n{bool}.
\begin{lstlisting}
#include <math.h>
isnan(-1.0/0.0);   // false
isnan(sqrt(-1.0)); // true
isinf(-1.0/0.0);   // true
isinf(sqrt(-1.0)); // false
\end{lstlisting}
\end{block}

\Level 0 {Common numbers}
\label{sec:std-numbers}

\begin{lstlisting}
#include <numbers>
static constexpr float pi = std::numbers::pi;
\end{lstlisting}
