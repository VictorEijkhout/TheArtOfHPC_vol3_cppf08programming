\Level 0 {The basic idea}

Sometimes you want to have the same function name for two slightly
different purposes. C++~allows you to define the same function twice,
as long as their parameters are different enough.

For instance, here is the same `sum' function defined for both
integers and reals:
%
\verbatimsnippet{polyfunc}
