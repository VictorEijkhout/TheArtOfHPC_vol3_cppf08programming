\Level 0 {Memory and scope}

If a variable goes \indextermsub{out of}{scope}, its memory is
deallocated.

Deallocating objects is slightly more complicated: a
\indexterm{destructor} is called.

\verbatimsnippet{destructor}
%
gives:
\begin{verbatim}
Before the nested scope
calling the constructor
Inside the nested scope
calling the destructor
After the nested scope
\end{verbatim}
